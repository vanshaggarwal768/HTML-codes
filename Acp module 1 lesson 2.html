        <h2>How the little flower name come from</h2>
        <p>The name of the school <strong>"Little Flower"</strong> comes from one of the greatest Saints of the time, <strong>St. Therese of Lisieux</strong>
        popularly known as Little Flower of Child Jesus. It was because of her child-like simplicity and total trust in the
        providence of God that she often saw visions of flower falling down from heaven. <strong>"Do little things with great love"</strong> says
       <i>Little Flower of Child Jesus</i> She believed in doing little things passionately with great zeal and enthusiasm."Only
        self surrender can place me in the arms of Jesus." said the Little Flower.</p>

        <h2>What is school emblem of this school</h2>
        <p>Our School emblem "To Love & To Serve" emerges from the life of this beautiful saint. The logo with the open hands show
        our readiness to serve God and humanity. The Open Book is the Holy Scripture, the Word of God who guides our life and
        the cross is the centre of life from where love, peace, joy and sacrifice flow.</p>
